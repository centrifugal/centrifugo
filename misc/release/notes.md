Centrifugo is an open-source scalable real-time messaging server. Centrifugo can instantly deliver messages to application online users connected over supported transports (WebSocket, HTTP-streaming, SSE/EventSource, GRPC, WebTransport). Centrifugo has the concept of a channel â€“ so it's a user-facing PUB/SUB server.

Centrifugo is language-agnostic and can be used to build chat apps, live comments, multiplayer games, real-time data visualizations, collaborative tools, etc. in combination with any backend. It is well suited for modern architectures and allows decoupling the business logic from the real-time transport layer.

Several official client SDKs for browser and mobile development wrap the bidirectional protocol. In addition, Centrifugo supports a unidirectional approach for simple use cases with no SDK dependency.

## What's changed

### Improvements

* Add development build warning in logs [#934](https://github.com/centrifugal/centrifugo/pull/934). On start, if Centrifugo is built from source without proper version attached (which is done in CI upon release workflow), the warning is now shown in logs.

### Fixes

* Fix not using redis prefix for Redis stream support check [centrifugal/centrifuge#456](https://github.com/centrifugal/centrifuge/pull/456). Addresses issue with Redis ACL, see [#935](https://github.com/centrifugal/centrifugo/issues/935).

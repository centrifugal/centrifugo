Centrifugo is a scalable real-time messaging server in language-agnostic way. Centrifugo works in conjunction with application backend written in any programming language. It runs as separate service and keeps persistent Websocket or SockJS connections from application clients (from web browsers or other environments like iOS/Android apps). When you need to deliver an event to your clients in real-time you publish it to Centrifugo API and Centrifugo then broadcasts event to all connected clients interested in this event (i.e. clients subscribed on event channel). In other words – this is a user-facing PUB/SUB server.

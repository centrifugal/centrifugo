Centrifugo is a real-time messaging server. It's language-agnostic and can be used in conjunction with application backend written in any programming language. Centrifugo runs as separate service and keeps persistent Websocket or SockJS connections from your application clients (from web browsers or other environments like iOS/Android apps). When you need to deliver event to your clients in real-time you publish it to Centrifugo API and Centrifugo then broadcasts event to all connected clients interested in this event (i.e. clients subscribed on event channel). In other words – this is PUB/SUB server.

See server [documentation](https://centrifugal.github.io/centrifugo/).

You can also find [this introduction post](https://medium.com/@fzambia/four-years-in-centrifuge-ce7a94e8b1a8) interesting – this is a story and motivation of Centrifugo.

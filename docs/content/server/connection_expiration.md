# Connection expiration

!!!danger

    This is a documentation for Centrifugo v2. The latest Centrifugo version is v3. Go to the [centrifugal.dev](https://centrifugal.dev) for v3 docs.

In authentication chapter we mentioned `exp` claim in connection token that allows to expire client connection at some point of time. In this chapter we will look at details on what happens when Centrifugo detects that connection is going to expire.

So first you should do is enable client expiration mechanism in Centrifugo providing connection token with expiration:

```python
import jwt
import time

token = jwt.encode({"sub": "42", "exp": int(time.time()) + 10*60}, "secret").decode()

print(token)
```

Let's suppose that you set `exp` field to timestamp that will expire in 10 minutes and client connected to Centrifugo with this token. During 10 mins connection will be kept by Centrifugo. When this time passed Centrifugo gives connection some time (configured, 25 seconds by default) to refresh its credentials and provide new valid token with new `exp`.

When client first connects to Centrifugo it receives `ttl` value in connect reply. That `ttl` value contains number of seconds after which client must send `refresh` command with new credentials to Centrifugo. Centrifugo clients must handle this `ttl` field and automatically start refresh process.

For example Javascript browser client  will send AJAX POST request to your application when it's time to refresh credentials. By default this request goes to `/centrifuge/refresh` url endpoint. In response your server must return JSON with new connection token:

```python
{
    "token": token
}
```

So you must just return the same connection token for your user when rendering page initially. But with actual valid `exp`. Javascript client will then send them to Centrifugo server and connection will be refreshed for a time you set in `exp`.

In this case you know which user want to refresh its connection because this is just a general request to your app - so your session mechanism will tell you about the user.

If you don't want to refresh connection for this user - just return 403 Forbidden on refresh request to your application backend.

Javascript client also has options to hook into refresh mechanism to implement your custom way of refreshing. Other Centrifugo clients also should have hooks to refresh credentials but depending on client API for this can be different - see specific client docs.

# RPM and DEB packages

Every time we make new Centrifugo release we upload rpm and deb packages for
popular linux distributions on [packagecloud.io](https://packagecloud.io/FZambia/centrifugo).

Currently we support versions of the following distributions:

* 64-bit Debian 7 Wheezy
* 64-bit Debian 8 Jessie
* 64-bit Ubuntu 14.04 Trusty
* 64-bit Ubuntu 16.04 Xenial
* 64-bit Centos 7
* 64-bit Centos 6

See [full list of available packages](https://packagecloud.io/FZambia/centrifugo) and
[installation instructions](https://packagecloud.io/FZambia/centrifugo/install).

Also note that if your linux distro is not in list you can ask us to package
for it or just download appropriate package from packagecloud that fits your
distribution.

Centrifugo also works on 32-bit architectures, but we don't support packaging for it
as 64-bit is more convenient for servers today.

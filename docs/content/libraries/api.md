# HTTP API clients

If you look at server API docs you will find that sending API request to Centrifugo is a very simple task to do in any programming language - this is just a POST request with JSON payload in body. See more in special chapter in server section.

We have several client libraries for different languages so you don't have to construct proper HTTP requests manually:

* [cent](https://github.com/centrifugal/cent) for Python
* [rubycent](https://github.com/centrifugal/rubycent) for Ruby (**not available for Centrifugo v2 yet**)
* [phpcent](https://github.com/centrifugal/phpcent) for PHP (**not available for Centrifugo v2 yet**)
* [jscent](https://github.com/centrifugal/jscent) for NodeJS (**not available for Centrifugo v2 yet**)
* [gocent](https://github.com/centrifugal/gocent) for Go (**not available for Centrifugo v2 yet**)
